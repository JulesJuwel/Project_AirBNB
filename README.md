Is there a way to predict a price for a new AirBNB room? What influences the price of an AirBNB room and is review really that important?

## Motivation

When someone without experience in the AirBNB business wants to set up a new room/appartment for AirBNB, he/she might not know what he/she can expect for a price. So I tried to find the main influences on the price for an AirBNB room and if there is a way to predict it.

## Installation

For running the code you only need numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn. 
Python 3.* was used for the attached files. If you use anything esle you might need to make some changes to the notebook.

## File description<a name="file-description"></a>

There is one notebook "AirBNB.ipynb" available. It holds all the necessary code for my 3 questions. I went through the main steps of data analysis in this pyhton-script:
1. Posting the Questions
2. Data Wrangling (Gather, Assess and Clean)
3. Explore the data
4. Draw Conclusions

## Results

As you may have noticed, the last step of data analysis is missing in the attached pyhton-notebook. I did the Communication part in the post available [here](https://medium.com/@julia.gilly/can-i-predict-a-price-for-a-new-airbnb-room-cf8d24d5483d).
